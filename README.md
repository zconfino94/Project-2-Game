# Project-2-Game
 
Built upon a previous game of a similar nature, but leaned more into UI elements, adding colours and changing button design. Also created code that indicated which button had been pressed so that in the case of an incorrect answer, the user would see a message confirming what flag they selected.

## Use Case

A game of guessing the correct flag to the corresponding country prompt

## Experiments

I edited the radial colour palette after each selection, however this resulted in confusing UI as I was unable to differentiate between selecting the flag and dismissing the alert controler prompt.

I had a running tally in the trailing bar item in my old game, but removed it in favour of a UI element at the bottom showing this.

I tried to have the UI counter increase after the alert controler prompt, but was unable to link this command to user input
